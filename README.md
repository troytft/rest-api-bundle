# REST API Bundle

[![Build Status](https://github.com/troytft/rest-api-bundle/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/troytft/rest-api-bundle/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

Features:
* Abstraction level for requests: describe jsonBody/queryString by php class, properties are configured by annotations 
* Abstraction level for responses: describe response object by php class, properties are configured by public getters
* Auto-generated documentation: generate OpenAPI specification without additional code, just add @Docs\Endpoint() annotation

Work in progress.
